## IMPORTANT

This repo is mostly full of code that can be found at https://github.com/jeffwilcox/4thandmayor/tree/master/src/Shared

This is a collection of prototypes, samples, and proof-of-concepts. None of this is meant to be used in production code, but you can take any of the ideas you like and try them out in your own projects.

## Current status
At this time most of the code here probably isn't going to build. The goal is to share code but not working projects in all situations.

Over time some of the more baked components should find their way into some of my more baked libraries here on GitHub. Hopefully.

## Special thanks
Special thanks to Mike and all the others who created the thejeffwilcox meme.
